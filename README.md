# Pyetro

### What?

Python basic lessons for kids.

### Why?

It's my try to teach the basics of coding in Python to my daughters and friends.

I'm learning how-to along the way, with their help.

## Getting started

Each lesson corresponds to a Jupyter Notebook file.

The good of using a Notebook: you can run the code and see the result.<br>You can also modify the code and learn what happen.

Click on the first file __"0-Getting-started.ipynb"__ so you can read a detailed explanation on how to use and make the Notebooks work.

## Thanks

Hope I can stick with this goal.

Hope you enjoy this.
